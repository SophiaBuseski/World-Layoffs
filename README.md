# World-Layoffs

## Project Overview 
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of world layoff data with the primary goal of cleaning and exploring the dataset to uncover significant patterns and trends. The data, sourced from Kaggle, was analyzed using Excel for initial exploration and MySQL for more detailed querying and analysis.

## Objective 
The main goal was to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis to answer specific questions about layoffs. This includes identifying the largest layoffs, understanding company shutdowns, and analyzing trends over time and across different regions and industries.

## Data 
- Excel Dataset [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/World-Layoffs/blob/main/layoffs.csv)
- Raw Code [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/World-Layoffs/blob/main/World%20Layoffs%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Exploratory%20Analysis.sql)

## Methodology 
  ### 1. Data Cleaning: 
  I initiated the project with a thorough data cleaning process. This process began with loading and initial inspections
  of data. Then I went to handle any missing values, correct data types, and ensure consistency across the dataset with
  formatting to ensure accuracy.
     
 ### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
 I used SQL queries to explore the dataset and answer key questions regarding layoffs, company sizes, industries
 affected, and temporal patterns.
     
  ### 3. Trend Analysis: 
  I calculated rolling totals and yearly comparisons to identify significant trends and patterns in the data.

## Key Findings 
### 1. Largest Layoff: 
The largest single layoff involved 12,000 employees in one day.

### 2. Company Shutdowns: 
Several startups had to shut down completely, resulting in 100% layoffs. Notably, Katerra in the construction industry had the biggest layoff when it shut down.

### 3. Major Layoff Events: 
Companies like Google (12,000), Meta (11,000), and Amazon (10,000) had the highest layoffs in a single event. In total, Amazon (18,150), Google (12,000), and Meta (11,000) recorded the most layoffs.

### 4. Temporal Patterns: 
The majority of layoffs occurred between March 3, 2020, and March 6, 2023, with 2022 experiencing the highest number of layoffs (160,661). Despite only three months of data in 2023, 125,677 people were already laid off, indicating a higher rate of layoffs for the year.

### 5. Geographical Distribution: 
The United States had the most layoffs, with the San Francisco Bay Area (125,631), Seattle (34,743), and New York City (29,364) being the top three affected areas.

### 6. Industry and Business Stage Impact: 
Layoffs were most prevalent in consumer, retail, "other," and transportation sectors. Post-IPO companies also experienced the highest number of layoffs.

### 7. Yearly Comparisons: 
By the end of 2021, there were 96,821 layoffs, which significantly increased by the end of 2022 and into early 2023

## Impact 
The insights from this project are crucial for businesses to understand the global layoff landscape and the impact of external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic on employment. These findings help in identifying vulnerable sectors and regions, allowing companies to strategize and prepare for potential economic downturns. Furthermore, understanding the patterns and causes of layoffs can aid policymakers and business leaders in making informed decisions to mitigate the adverse effects on the workforce.

By leveraging SQL for detailed data exploration and analysis, this project demonstrates the importance of data-driven decision-making in understanding and responding to large-scale employment trends.
